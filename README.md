Data Analysis Project with Codebasics

🎓 I recently completed an exciting data analysis assignment with Codebasics, where I deepened my skills in Power Pivot, DAX, ETL processes, and Pivot Tables.

📊 A special thank you to Dhaval Patel and Hemanand Vadivel for their incredible teaching and mentorship throughout the bootcamp. Your guidance has been invaluable. 🙏
